# Mous Front End Developer task

## Setup:
- Clone the repo.
- Run `npm install` to install the required dependencies.
- To run the local environment, run `gulp`.

## Task:
- We would like you to write the JS and CSS to show the staff members when clicking on the button.
- Some of the code has been written for you but feel free to change it if you feel necessary.
- The staff data is included as an import, use this to populate the list of staff members.
- Use ES6 (if you can) and _do not_ use jQuery.

## Bonus points:
- If you can structure the JS in a way that would emulate how data would be retrieved from a live database (think promises).
- Matching the syntax that is already there.
- Using modern techniques to achieve the result.

Good luck and feel free to get in contact if you have any questions.
